<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

There are many good POS systems available online, however, as I am only a freshman in university, I wanted to see how the backend, and frontend worked together. Thus, I decided to learn to build the POS system from scratch. 

Since Covid-19 is widespread, I have a bunch more free time at home, thus another reason to build it is for my family business. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
